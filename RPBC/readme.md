Program in the main.cpp encodes the sequence of integers with the byte codes with restricted prefix properties (RPBC) [1] and tests the speed of the fast decoding algorithm.

The program has 4 command line arguments:

1) number of test iterations
2) input file (sequence of 32-bit numbers)
3) file to write code
4) file to write decoded numbers
