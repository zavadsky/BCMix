Program in the main.cpp file demonstrates:
- encoding the sequence of integers
- finding the optimal code for the given sequence
- testing the fast decoding speed

The program has 4 command line arguments:
[1] number of iterations of the decoding test loop
[2] name of the input file
[3] name of the output file for the encoded bitstream
[4] name of the output file for the decoded numbers

The input file should contain the sequence of 32-bit unsigned integers.
