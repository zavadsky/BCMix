Program in the main.cpp encodes the sequence of integers with Huffman codes and tests the speed of the decoding algorithm (presumably, faster than the canonical Huffman code decoding).

The program has 4 command line arguments:

number of test iterations
input file (sequence of 32-bit numbers)
file to write code
file to write decoded numbers
